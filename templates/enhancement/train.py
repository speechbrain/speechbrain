"""Recipe for training a speech enhancement system with spectral masking.

To run this recipe, do the following:
> python train.py train.yaml --data_folder /path/to/save/mini_librispeech

To read the code, first scroll to the bottom to see the "main" code.
This gives a high-level overview of what is going on, while the
Brain class definition provides the details of what happens
for each batch during training.

The first time you run it, this script should automatically download
and prepare the Mini Librispeech dataset for computation. Noise and
reverberation are automatically added to each sample from OpenRIR.
