    "\n",
    "SpeechBrain data-IO follows and extends [PyTorch data loading](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html). This preface section recaps PyTorch data loading and does not yet consider the SpeechBrain data loading extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "PyTorch data loading can run in many configurations,\n",
    "but a typical approach has these basic elements:\n",
    "- a [Dataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset), which loads data points one-at-a-time.\n",
    "- a [collation function](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#dataloader-collate-fn), or ``collate_fn`` for short, which takes a list of data points and forms a batch.\n",
    "- a [Sampler](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#data-loading-order-and-sampler), which determines the order in which the Dataset is iterated.\n",
    "- a [DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader), which combines the elements above (and has defaults for ``collate_fn`` and Sampler), and orchestrates the whole pipeline.\n",

    "### Dataset\n",
    "The role of the Dataset is to produce single data points. Typically they are loaded off the disk, but they could also come from some more complex source or in some cases just from RAM. You can write your own Dataset subclass or sometimes you can use a standardized class. The training, validation, and test subsets get their own Dataset instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dataset interface is simple; it implements\n",
    "`__getitem__` and usually also `__len__`. Usually, \"map-style\" Datasets are used, but it's worth noting that PyTorch also has a notion of [IterableDataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#iterable-style-datasets)s.\n",
    "\n",
    "`__getitem__` can return _anything_ because data can look like _anything_. Often, though, a data point consists of multiple associated things (e.g. an image and a label, or a speech waveform and its transcription). The Dataset should return all of these associated things.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The DataLoader takes the other elements above and many other arguments such as batch size. The DataLoader has basic defaults for all arguments (except the Dataset, of course), but it's worthwhile to understand the [args](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader).\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataLoader object is iterated in the training loop, and every Dataset instance (e.g. training, validation, test) gets its own DataLoader.\n",

    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterator that DataLoader returns can either load batches in the same process that it is created in (`num_workers=0`), or it can start a new process (`num_workers=1`) or multiple new processes (`num_workers>1`). Because of the Global Interpreter Lock, Python cannot work on two tasks at the same time in a single process. Using at least one background worker process to load data while simultaneously running training is often essential for taking full advantage of GPU compute resources."
