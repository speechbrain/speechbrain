    "# **Introduction to SpeechBrain**\n",
    "\n",
    "SpeechBrain is an **open-source** **all-in-one** speech toolkit based on **PyTorch**. It is designed to make the research and development of speech technology easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "There are many speech and audio processing tasks of great practical and scientific interest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, the dominant approach was to develop a **different toolkit for each different task**. Nevertheless, learning several toolkits is **time-demanding**, might require knowledge of **different programming languages**,  and forces you to familiarize yourself with  **different code styles and standards** (e.g., data readers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, most of these tasks can be implemented with the same **deep learning**  technology.\n",
    "We thus explicitly designed SpeechBrain to natively support **multiple speech processing tasks**. We think that this might make much easier the life of speech developers. Moreover, we think that the combination of different speech technologies in single **end-to-end** and **fully differential system** will be crucial in the development of future speech technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We did our best to design a toolkit which is:\n",
    "*   *Easy to use*\n",
    "*   *Easy to customize*\n",
    "*  *Flexible*\n",
    "* *Modular*\n",
    "* *Well-documented*"

    "## Supported Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "You can thus use speechbrain to convert *speech-to-text*, to perform authentication using `speaker verification`, to enhance the quality of the speech signal, to combine the information from multiple microphones, and for many other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, SpeechBrain currently supports many conversational AI technologies, including:\n",

    "- Language Modeling\n",
    "- Response Generation\n",
    "- Grapheme-to-Phoneme\n",

    "## Hyperparameter specification with YAML\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning systems often require the specification of several hyperparameters. In SpeechBrain, we do it with YAML. YAML allows us to specify the hyperparameters in an elegant,  flexible,  and transparent way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see for instance this yaml snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "dropout: 0.8\n",
    "compute_features: !new:speechbrain.lobes.features.MFCC\n",
    "    n_mels: 40\n",
    "    left_frames: 5\n",
    "    right_frames: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "model: !new:speechbrain.lobes.models.CRDNN.CRDNN\n",
    "   input_shape: [null, null, 440]\n",
    "   activation: !name:torch.nn.LeakyReLU []\n",
    "   dropout:  !ref <dropout>\n",
    "   cnn_blocks: 2\n",
    "   cnn_channels: (32, 16)\n",
    "   cnn_kernelsize: (3, 3)\n",
    "   time_pooling: True\n",
    "   rnn_layers: 2\n",
    "   rnn_neurons: 512\n",
    "   rnn_bidirectional: True\n",
    "   dnn_blocks: 2\n",
    "   dnn_neurons: 1024\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this is not just a plain list of hyperparameters. For each parameter, we specify the class (or function) that is going to use it. This makes the code **more transparent** and **easier to debug**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The YAML file contains all the information to initialize the classes when loading them. In SpeechBrain we load it with a special function called `load_hyperpyyaml`, which initializes for us all the declared classes. This makes the code extremely **readable** and **compact**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hyperpyyaml is an extension of the standard YAML. For an overview of all the supported functionalities, please take a look at the [YAML tutorial](https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/basics/hyperpyyaml.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all the hyperparameters can be overridden from the command line. For instance, to change the dropout factor:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python experiment.py params.yaml --dropout=0.5 `\n",

    "## Experiment File\n",
    "The experiment file (e.g., `example_asr_ctc_experiment.py` in the example) trains a model by **combining** the functions or **classes declared in the yaml file**. This script defines the data processing pipeline and defines all the computations from the input signal to the final cost function. Everything is designed to be** easy to customize**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Specification\n",
    "The user should prepare a data specification file (in **CSV** or JSON) format that reports all the data and the labels to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in the minimal example ran before, the data specification file is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "ID, duration, wav, wav_format, wav_opts, spk_id, spk_id_format, spk_id_opts, ali, ali_format, ali_opts, phn, phn_format, phn_opts,char,char_format,char_opts\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can open this file with a CSV reader for better rendering. For each row, you have an example with the corresponding paths to wav signal and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative, users can specify the data in a **JSON** format:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"spk1_snt5\": {\n",
    "        \"wav\": \"{data_root}/spk1_snt5.wav\",\n",
    "        \"length\": 2.6,\n",
    "        \"spk_id\": \"spk1\",\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is less compact than CSV but more flexible. For many applications, using the CSV file is enough. For more complex tasks (e.g, speaker diarization, speaker diarization + recognition), however, people might take advantage of the hierarchical structure offered by JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "All datasets are formatted differently. In general, the users have to write a **data preparation** script that parses the target dataset and creates the data specification files. For all the proposed recipes, however, we also release the corresponding data preparation library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data processing pipeline\n",
    "Thanks to our Dynamic datasets, the data reading pipeline is fully customizable in the experiment file directly. For instance, in the minimal example, you can define the following intuitive function to read the audio file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # 2. Define audio pipeline:\n",
    "    @sb.utils.data_pipeline.takes(\"wav\")\n",
    "    @sb.utils.data_pipeline.provides(\"sig\")\n",
    "    def audio_pipeline(wav):\n",
    "        sig = sb.dataio.dataio.read_audio(wav)\n",
    "        return sig\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes in input the wav path and returns a signal read with the specified reader. In the variable `batch.sig` (see `example_asr_ctc_experiment.py`) you will have your batches of signals ready to be used. Note that here you can add any kind of processing (e.g, adding noise, speech change, dynamic mixing, etc) just by coding with the desired pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar function should be written for all the entries that our script is supposed to process. The minimal example, for instance, reads a sequence of phoneme labels as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    @sb.utils.data_pipeline.takes(\"phn\")\n",
    "    @sb.utils.data_pipeline.provides(\"phn_list\", \"phn_encoded\")\n",
    "    def text_pipeline(phn):\n",
    "        phn_list = phn.strip().split()\n",
    "        yield phn_list\n",
    "        phn_encoded = label_encoder.encode_sequence_torch(phn_list)\n",
    "        yield phn_encoded\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we read the phoneme list, separate each entry by space, and convert the list of phonemes to their corresponding indexes (using the label_encoder described [in this tutorial](https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/basics/data-loading-pipeline.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we directly expose in the main script the data reading pipeline because this adds a lot of transparency and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom forward and cost computation methods\n",
    "The other thing that users often want to customize is the sequence of computations that go from the input to the final cost function. In the experiment file, users are required to specify them in the `forward` and `compute_objectives` methods.\n",
    "In the minimal example, the forward method is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def compute_forward(self, batch, stage):\n",
    "        \"Given an input batch it computes the output probabilities.\"\n",
    "        wavs, lens = batch.sig\n",
    "        feats = self.hparams.compute_features(wavs)\n",
    "        feats = self.modules.mean_var_norm(feats, lens)\n",
    "        x = self.modules.model(feats)\n",
    "        x = self.modules.lin(x)\n",
    "        outputs = self.hparams.softmax(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is the variable batch that contains all the entries specified in the data loader (e.g, we have `batch.sig` and `batch.phn_encoded`). As you can see, we compute the features, we perform a mean and variance normalization, and we call the model. Finally, a linear transformation + softmax is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The compute objective function looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def compute_objectives(self, predictions, batch, stage):\n",
    "        \"Given the network predictions and targets computed the CTC loss.\"\n",
    "        predictions, lens = predictions\n",
    "        phns, phn_lens = batch.phn_encoded\n",
    "        loss = self.hparams.compute_cost(predictions, phns, lens, phn_lens)\n",
    "\n",
    "        if stage != sb.Stage.TRAIN:\n",
    "            seq = sb.decoders.ctc_greedy_decode(\n",
    "                predictions, lens, blank_id=self.hparams.blank_index\n",
    "            )\n",
    "            self.per_metrics.append(batch.id, seq, phns, target_len=phn_lens)\n",
    "\n",
    "        return loss\n",
    "```\n",
    "We take the predictions done in the forward step and compute a cost function using the encoded labels in batch.phn_encoded. During validation/test, we also perform actual decoding on the speech sequence (in this case using a greedy decoder and, in a more general case, using beam search) to monitor the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brain Class\n",
    "To make training easier, we implemented a simple trainer called **Brain class**. The Brain class defines a set of customizable routines that implement all the steps needed in standard **training and validation loops**. After defining the data pipeline, the forward, the compute objective, and other custom methods, you can call the fit method of the brain class for training (and the eval one for the test):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Trainer initialization\n",
    "    ctc_brain = CTCBrain(hparams[\"modules\"], hparams[\"opt_class\"], hparams)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Training/validation loop\n",
    "    ctc_brain.fit(\n",
