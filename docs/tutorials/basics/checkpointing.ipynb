    "# Checkpointing\n",
    "\n",
    "By *checkpointing*, we mean saving the model and all the other necessary state information (like optimizer parameters, which epoch, and which iteration), at a particular point in time. For experiments, this has two main motivations:\n",
    "- *Recovery*. Continuing an experiment from half-way through. A compute-cluster job can run out of time or memory, or there can be some simple error, which stops the experiment script before it finishes. In that case, all progress that isn't saved to disk is lost.\n",
    "- *Early stopping*. During training, performance should be monitored on a separate validation set, which gives an estimate of generalization. When training progresses, we expect validation error to decrease at first. If we train too long, though, validation error can start to increase again (due to *overfitting*). After training, we should go back to the model parameters that performed best on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, it is also important to save the trained model parameters, so that the model can be used outside the experiment script.\n"
