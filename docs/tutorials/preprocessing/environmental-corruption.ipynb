    "# Environmental Corruption\n",
    "\n",
    "In realistic speech processing scenarios, the signals captured by microphones are often corrupted by unwanted elements such as **noise** and **reverberation**. This challenge is particularly pronounced in **distant-talking** (far-field) situations, where the speaker and the reference microphone are positioned at a considerable distance. Examples of such scenarios include signals recorded by popular devices like Google Home, Amazon Echo, Kinect, and similar devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common strategy in neural speech processing involves starting with clean speech recordings and artificially introducing noise and reverberation to simulate real-world conditions. This process is known as **environmental corruption** or *speech contamination*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with clean signals allows for the controlled introduction of various types of noise and reverberation, making environmental corruption a potent regularization technique. This regularization helps neural networks generalize better when exposed to real-world, noisy conditions during testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environmental corruption process transforms a clean signal $x[n]$ into a noisy and reverberant signal using the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y[n] = x[n] * h[n] + n[n]$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n[n]$ represents a noise sequence, and $h[n]$ is an impulse response that introduces the reverberation effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will delve into the details of how this transformation is carried out. Before that, let's download some signals that will be essential for the rest of the tutorial.\n",
