    "# Fourier Transforms and Spectrograms\n",
    "\n",
    "In speech and audio processing, the signal in the time-domain is often transformed into another domain. Ok, but why do we need to transform an audio signal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some speech characteristics/patterns of the signal (e.g, *pitch*, *formats*) might not be very evident when looking at the audio in the time-domain. With properly designed transformations, it might be easier to extract the needed information from the signal itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular transformation is the **Fourier Transform**, which turns the time-domain signal into an equivalent representation in the **frequency domain**. In the following sections, we will describe the Fourier transforms along with other related transformations such as **Short-Term Fourier Transform** (STFT) and **spectrograms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Fourier Transform\n",
    "The Fourier transform of a time-discrete sequences $f[n]={f[0],f[1],..f[N-1]}$ is called Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and it is defined in this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$F_{k} = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f_{n} e^{-j\\frac{2\\pi}{N}kn}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse transformation, called Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT), maps the frequnecy-domain signal $F_k$ into a time-domain one $f_n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_{n} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} F_{k} e^{j\\frac{2\\pi}{N}kn}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The two representations are equivalent and we are not losing information when applying them. It is just a different way to represent the same signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the intuition?\n",
    "The idea behind the Fourier transform is to represent the signal as a **weighted sum of complex sinusoids with increasing frequency**.\n",
    "The complex exponential $e^{j\\frac{2\\pi}{N}kn}$, for instance, dermines the frequnecy of this \"complex sinoudoid\":\n",
    "\n",
    "$e^{j\\frac{2\\pi}{N}kn} = cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}kn) +j sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}kn)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $F_{k}$, instead, is another **complex number** that determines the amplitude and shift (phase) of the frequency components.\n",
    "It can be shown that with N complex sinusoids with proper **amplitude** and **phase**, we can model any signal. In other words, the complex sinusoids are the basic bricks that compose your signal. If you properly combine many of them like in a LEGO building, you can create all the signals you want (both periodic and non-periodic).\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation has $O(N^2)$ complexity because for each element k of the frequency representation $F_k$ we have to loop over all the N elements of the sequence. This makes it impossible to compute DFT and IDFT of long sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately,  there are algorithms called **Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT)** that can compute it with $O(Nlog(N))$. The FFT splits the input sequences into small chunks and combines their DTFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept of \"complex sinusoids\" might be quite difficult to digest. Nevertheless, on-line you can find excellent material full of cool graphical animations to help you with that (see the tutorials in the reference). For now, let's just consider the Fourier transform as a **linear transformation** that maps real-valued sequences into complex-valued ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before computing some DTFTs, let's download some speech signal and install speechbrain:"
