    "# Complex and Quaternion Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the SpeechBrain implementation of complex-valued and quaternion-valued neural networks for speech technologies. It covers the basics of highdimensional representations and the associated neural layers : Linear, Convolution, Recurrent and Normalisation.\n",

    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complex Numbers:**\n",
    "Complex numbers extend the concept of real numbers into a two-dimensional space. Comprising a real and an imaginary part, a complex number `z` is typically expressed as `z = r + ix`, where `r` is the real part and `ix` is the imaginary part. This mathematical extension finds diverse applications in real-world scenarios, offering a powerful algebraic framework for manipulating concepts in two-dimensional space, such as rotations, translations, and phase-related operations. Complex numbers naturally represent the speech signal, with the Fourier transform being a notable example that operates in the complex space, capturing amplitude and phase information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quaternion Numbers:**\n",
    "Quaternions generalize complex numbers to the three-dimensional space, featuring a real (`r`) and an imaginary part, which is a 3D vector (`ix + jy + kz`). A quaternion `q` can be expressed as `q = r + ix + jy + kz`. In practice, quaternions define 3D rotations and find extensive utility in physics, computer science, computer graphics, and robotics. They provide a stable and natural framework for conceiving and interpreting movements in three-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to Neural Networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "As the resurgence of modern deep learning gained momentum, researchers explored the integration of complex and quaternion numbers into neural networks to address specific tasks. Complex-valued neural networks (CVNN) can directly handle the output of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), while quaternion neural networks (QNN) can be implemented to generate realistic robot movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond their natural fit for certain representations, CVNN and QNN share a compelling property: **weight sharing**. The algebraic rules governing complex and quaternion numbers differ from those of real numbers, influencing the multiplication of quaternions or complex numbers. This distinction leads to a unique mechanism of **weight sharing** within Q-CVNN, as opposed to traditional dot products in real-valued networks. This mechanism has proven to be exceptionally useful for learning expressive representations of multidimensional inputs while preserving internal relationships within the signal components, such as amplitude and phase for complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we won't delve into all the intricacies of these properties due to their extensive nature. Instead, we aim to provide a detailed guide on how to effectively implement and utilize CVNN and QNN within SpeechBrain.\n",

    "## SpeechBrain Representation of Complex and Quaternions\n",
    "\n",
    "In SpeechBrain, algebraic operations are abstracted in the neural layers, freeing users from the need to focus on the initial representation. This abstraction ensures that users can manipulate real-valued tensors without explicitly declaring a specific tensor type for complex or quaternion numbers. The underlying operations are expressed in a tensor/matrix format, facilitating seamless integration with modern GPU architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, any PyTorch tensor generated in your recipe can be interpreted as a complex or quaternion-valued tensor, depending on the layer that processes it. For instance:\n",
    "- If processed by a `torch.nn.Linear` layer, the tensor will be real.\n",
    "- If processed by a `nnet.complex_networks.c_linear.CLinear` layer, the tensor will be complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are tensors interpreted and constructed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate with an example. Suppose we want to consider a tensor containing `3` complex numbers or `3` quaternions. The different parts of the numbers will be concatenated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complex tensor (`c_tensor`): `[r, r, r, x, x, x]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For a quaternion tensor (`q_tensor`): `[r, r, r, x, x, x, y, y, y, z, z, z]`\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexibility allows any tensor declared in your code to be viewed as a complex or quaternion tensor when processed by a {C/Q}-Layer in SpeechBrain, as long as the features dimension can be divided by 2 for complex numbers and 4 for quaternion numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this further, let's proceed with the installation of SpeechBrain."

    "\n",
    "At the core of QNN and CVNN is the product. Of course, others specificities exist such as the weight initialisation, specific normalisations, activation functions etc. Nevertheless, the basic product is central to all neural network layers : a weight matrix that multplies the input vector.\n",

    "\n",

    "d & -c & b & a\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "And even more interestingly, if we multiply two of these matrices, then we obtain the product corresponding to the considered algebra. For instance, the complex product between two complex number is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\left(\\begin{array}{rr}\n",
    "a & -b \\\\\n",

    "(a+\\mathrm{i} b)(c+\\mathrm{i} d)=(a c-b d)+\\mathrm{i}(a d+b c).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ok, so how is this implemented in SpeechBrain**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Every single layer that you can call either on the complex or quaternion libraries will follow two steps:\n",
    "1. *init()*: Define the complex / quaternion weights as torch.Parameters and initialise them with the adapted scheme.\n",
    "2. *forward()*: Call the corresponding operation that implements the specific product. For instance, a complex linear layer would call the `complex_linear_op()` from `speechbrain.nnet.complex_networks.c_ops`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the `speechbrain.nnet.complex_networks.c_ops.complex_linear_op` function simply:\n",
    "1. Takes the weights of the layer and builds the corresponding real-valued matrix.\n",
    "2. Apply a product between the input and this matrix to simulate the complex / quaternion products.\n",

    "### Quaternion Spinor Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Quaternion Spinor Neural Networks (SNN) represent a specialized category within quaternion-valued neural networks (QNN). As mentioned earlier, quaternions are designed to represent rotations. In QNN layers, the fundamental operation involves the Hamilton product (`inputs x weights`), where inputs and weights are sets of quaternions. This product essentially creates a new rotation equivalent to the composition of the first rotation followed by the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rotation Composition:**\n",
    "Multiplying two quaternions results in a rotation that combines the individual rotations represented by each quaternion. For instance, given `q3 = q1 x q2`, it implies that *q3 is a rotation equivalent to a rotation by q1 followed by a rotation from q2*. In the context of Spinor Neural Networks, this concept is employed to compose new rotations, not to physically rotate objects, but to predict sequential rotations. For example, predicting the next movement of a robot involves using the previous movement (represented as a quaternion) as input to produce a new quaternion as the output, capturing the expected next movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modeling Rotations with SNN:**\n",
    "Spinor Neural Networks (SNN) are specifically designed to model rotations. In scenarios like robotic movements, SNNs take 3D coordinates (x, y, z) of the object before the movement as input and predict its coordinates after the movement as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Rotation Equation:**\n",
    "To achieve this, the standard product in all layers of the network is replaced with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\vec{v_{output}} = q_{weight} \\vec{v_{input}} q^{-1}_{weight}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation formally defines the rotation of a vector $\\vec{v}$ by a unit quaternion $q_{weight}$ (with a norm of 1), where $q^{-1}$ represents the conjugate of the quaternion. Both left and right products in this equation are Hamilton products.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Quaternion Spinor Neural Networks are tailored to model rotations, making them particularly suitable for applications where predicting sequential rotations or movements is crucial, such as in robotics or animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ok, so how is this implemented in SpeechBrain?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exact same manner than for the standard Hamilton product! Indeed, such rotation can also be represented as a matrix product:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}-d^{2} & 2 b c-2 a d & 2 a c+2 b d \\\\\n",
    "2 a d+2 b c & a^{2}-b^{2}+c^{2}-d^{2} & 2 c d-2 a b \\\\\n",
    "2 b d-2 a c & 2 a b+2 c d & a^{2}-b^{2}-c^{2}+d^{2}\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we just need to define the `quaternion_op` that follows the same usual process:\n",
    "1. Compose a real-valued matrix from the different weight components\n",
    "2. Apply a matrix product between the input and this rotation matrix!\n",
    "\n",

    "Two remarks on Spinor layers:\n",
    "1. We need to set a vector_scale to train deep models. The vector scale is just an other set torch.Parameters that will scale down the output of each Spinor layers. Indeed, the output of a SNN layer is a set of 3D vectors that are the sum of rotated 3D vectors. Quaternion rotations do not affect the magnitude of the rotated vector. Hence, by summing over and over rotated 3D vectors, we might end up very quickly with very large values (i.e the training will explode).\n",
    "2. You might consider to use `weight_init='unitary'`. Indeed, quaternion rotations are valid only if the considered quaternion is unitary. Therefore, starting with unitary weights may facilitate the learning phase!\n",
