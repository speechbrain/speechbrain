    "# Fine-tuning or using Whisper, wav2vec2, HuBERT and others with SpeechBrain and HuggingFace\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial describes how to combine (use and finetune) pretrained models coming from the HuggingFace Transformers library including, for instance, Whisper, wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM and others. Those models can be plugged easily into SpeechBrain to approach a speech- or audio-related task: automatic speech recognition, speaker recognition, spoken language understanding ...\n",
    "\n",
    "**What About Pre-training?**\n",
    "Pre-training large SSL models is complex for many reasons ranging from necessary resources (dozens of GPUs for hundreds of hours) to replicability issues due to the pipeline. For now, SpeechBrain only provides pre-training of [wav2vec 2.0 models](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/develop/recipes/LibriSpeech/self-supervised-learning/wav2vec2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why SpeechBrain?**\n",
    "Different and numerous reasons may be mentioned to motivate the use of SpeechBrain. However, in the very specific context of pretrained models, SpeechBrain enables researchers and users to connect these architectures to state-of-the-art speech and audio-related technologies. For instance, SpeechBrain allows you to easily fine-tune a pretrained wav2vec2 model with a transformer decoder coupled with a beam search algorithm and a transformer language model to build a SOTA speech recognizer. It could also help you to simply use the encoder of a pretrained Whisper to perform emotion recognition.To the best of our knowledge, most of other toolkit do not enable you to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architectures of interest for this tutorial**\n",
    "We will only consider two of the most up-to-date existing pretrained model: wav2vec 2.0 and Whisper. However, SpeechBrain support many others: wavLM, HuBERT ...\n",

    "\n",
    "Wav2vec 2.0 models were originally shared via the [Faiseq GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/master/examples/wav2vec/README.md) and moved very recently to [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/facebook) thanks to a nice integration to the HuggingFace [Transformers API](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/wav2vec2.html). The same thing happened with Whisper model than went from the [original repository](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to the HuggingFace [Transformers API](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/whisper). Hence, if you want to use a pretrained Transformer model within SpeechBrain you only need a HuggingFace repository! (e.g. \"facebook/wav2vec2-large-lv60\", \"openai/whisper-large\" or \"microsoft/wavlm-large\").\n",

Hence, this output dimension is *768* for the Base model (as described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477)). Then, wav2vec2 has an output frequency of 50Hz, and the audio file is 2.87 seconds long explaining the *143* that we obtain in the time dimension. Indeed the shape is [batch, time, features]. The same logic can be applied to Whisper as we obtain the last hidden state of the transformer encoder.\n",

If you just run your recipe like that, your whisper / wav2vec 2.0 pre-trained encoder will be part of your architecture and be fine-tuned (or not) depending on your requirements.\n",

    "## Using Whisper as a fully pre-trained encoder-decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Whisper is a full transformer. In theory, this means that you could take it and perform zero-shot speech recognition or speech translation. In practice, you most-likely want to fine-tune it on your in-house dataset. Both options can be done within SpeechBrain, and we only need to slightly change our YAML and recipe accordingly. Indeed, we won't need a DNN decoder anymore, as Whisper has one. We won't rely on the CTC loss as well, as the Transformer decoder can be trained with a negative log-likelihood. Finally, we must decide if we want to connect our model to a greedy search decoding or to a more complex beam searcher with or without language model scoring! A summary of what is supported by SpeechBrain for Whisper is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature extraction\n",
    "- Encoder fine-tuning\n",
    "- Encoder-decoder zero shot ASR or ST\n",
    "- Encoder-decoder fine-tuning\n",
    "- Greedy decoding\n",
    "- Beam search decoding with and without LM\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will focus on fine-tuning a base whisper on Librispeech with a greedy decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this we must first modify our previous YaML file, and python script. Here, we needs to set the `encoder_only` to `False` because we wants to keeps the decoder. We also needs to integrate a search function that will takes the most probable token predicted by the decoder and feed it back (concatenated with the previous tokens) to the decoder in an auto regressive manner.\n",
    "Contrary to the previous example, we don't need to add a language modeling head on top of the Whisper decoder because it will be already created for you when you will fetch the Whisper model. Now you have everything needed for fine-tuning the Whisper Encoder-Decoder!\n",
