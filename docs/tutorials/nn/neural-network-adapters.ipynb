    "# Neural Network Adapters for faster low-memory fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers the SpeechBrain implementation of adapters such as LoRA. This includes how to integrate either SpeechBrain implemented adapters, custom adapters, and adapters from libraries such as PEFT into a pre-trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- [Speech Recognition From Scratch](https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tasks/speech-recognition-from-scratch.html)\n",
    "- A CUDA-enabled device for running this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As pre-trained models become larger and more capable, there is growing interest in methods for adapting them for specific tasks in a memory-efficient way, within a reasonable time span. One such technique is freezing the original parameters and inserting a small number of additional parameters into the original model, which are called \"adapters.\" These adapters can often match the performance of full fine-tuning at a fraction of the parameter count, meaning faster and more memory-efficient fine-tuning [1]. One popular technique for doing this is known as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "On the software side, HuggingFace has produced a popular library for adapters called PEFT [3]. Our implementation includes some of the features of this library, as well as including the ability to integrate PEFT adapters into a SpeechBrain model. We'll start with a basic example YAML so you can just try it yourself if you learn better from experimentation.\n",

    "## Too Long ; Didn't Read\n",
    "\n",
    "The TL;DR of this tutorial is that you should use a section like this in your HyperPyYAML file to create a model with adapters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "adapted_model: !new:speechbrain.nnet.adapters.AdaptedModel\n",
    "    model_to_adapt: !ref <model>\n",
    "    adapter_class: !name:speechbrain.nnet.adapters.LoRA\n",
    "    all_linear: True\n",
    "    unfrozen_layers: [\"conv_1d_*\"]\n",
    "    adapter_kwargs:\n",
    "        rank: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding this section to the YAML takes the already-defined key `model` and adds a LoRA adapter to every linear layer with the keyword argument `rank=8`.\n",
    "The `all_linear` and `all_conv` arguments simply add adapters to all linear or all convolution layers respectively.\n",
    "By default, this class freezes the parameters of all layers that are not adapted, but the `unfrozen_layers` argument can be used to specify the names\n",
    "of layers that should also be trained, at the cost of a higher parameter count. One can specify specific layers that should be adapted with\n",
    "the `target_layers` argument. These arguments both support unix-style wildcards through the use of python's `fnmatch` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the TL;DR isn't enough and you need to work through an example in more detail, continue to the next section."
