    "# Data Loading for Big Datasets and Shared Filesystems\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have a large dataset stored in a shared filesystem, and you want to use it for training a neural network? Is this dataset so large that it doesn't even fit into the local SSD of your computation nodes? If so, this tutorial will walk you through all the needed steps to manage reading large files from a shared filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many compute clusters, the main data storage is a network filesystem (NFS), for example [Lustre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(file_system)). <!-- ignore-url-check --> The NFS can serve many users concurrently and provide high data throughput from a single file. However, opening or listing many different files is slow - and doing so may slow the whole system down for everyone, not just the offending user. Speech datasets usually consist of very many small recordings. Reading every file again and again is exactly the kind of data IO that can slow down an NFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is to copy the dataset into the **local SSD** of the computing node. This can be done relatively efficiently by compressing the dataset into a single file (e.g. `dataset.tar.gz`), copying it into the local node, and finally, uncompressing (untarring) the file. Reading files from the local SSD is very efficient and does not harm the performance of the shared filesystem.\n",
    "The standard SpeechBrain data IO works well in this case, see [this tutorial](https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/basics/data-loading-pipeline.html).\n",
    "However, there might be huge datasets that exceed the size of your local SSD.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A possible workaround is to keep the data in the shared filesystem and bundle the small recordings into larger archives, which are usually called **shards**. Loading data off shards avoids opening too many files, so it is fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "When reading data from shards, random access across the dataset is no longer possible. Data is read sequentially, from a **stream**. This requires a bit of care in preparing the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case for sharded IO laid out above is typical in an academic compute-cluster setup. Streaming data IO can also be used in even larger scales with dedicated data servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will use the **WebDataset** library. Alternatives and the case for WebDataset are laid out by the WebDataset developer in [this PyTorch proposal](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/38419).\n"

    "## What is WebDataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "[WebDataset](https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset) is a sharded (streaming) data IO library that works well with PyTorch. WebDataset uses standard TAR archives as the shard format, with the simple convention that all consequtive files that have the same basename belong to the same example. So listing `data-archive/shard-0000.tar`s contents can look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> tar -t data-archives/shard-0000.tar\n",
    "spk1-utt1.wav\n",
    "spk1-utt1.txt\n",
    "spk1-utt1.json\n",
    "spk1-utt2.wav\n",
    "spk1-utt2.txt\n",
    "spk1-utt2.json\n",
    "spk2-utt1wav\n",
    "spk2-utt1.txt\n",
    "spk2-utt1.json\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the Python side, the dataset interface is an [IterableDataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#iterable-style-datasets), and it has a set of methods which can be chained to build a data pipeline, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import webdataset as wds  # Note the typical import shorthand\n",
    "dataset = (\n",
    "      wds.WebDataset(\"data-archives/shard-00{00...24}.tar\")  # 25 shards\n",
    "      .decode()  # Automagically decode files\n",
    "      .shuffle(size=1000)  # Shuffle on-the-fly in a buffer\n",
    "      .batch(batchsize=10)  # Create batches\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that WebDataset is (at least at the time of writing) a fast moving library. It is also being considered for inclusion in the PyTorch core. Again, read more [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/38419) and [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/efficient-pytorch-io-library-for-large-datasets-many-files-many-gpus/).\n",

    "## WebDataset with SpeechBrain\n",
    "\n",
    "SpeechBrain is compatible with any PyTorch data loading, so WebDataset can be used without any extensions (as we have done so far). However, three problems remain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Data in shards is typically not sorted (or is even deliberately shuffled). Consecutive utterances will be of very different lengths, and need a lot of padding.\n",
    "2.   The intra-epoch checkpointing in the SaveableDataLoader does not work with IterableDatasets.\n",
    "3.   Exact epochs are very difficult to acheive with Distributed Data Parallel. (This problem is not specific to WebDataset or SpeechBrain.)\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems are solved with the following strategies and extensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SpeechBrain implements an on-the-fly dynamic batching and bucketing iterator. This works together with `webdataset.WebDataset`.\n",
    "  - Bucketing puts similar length utterances in the same batch, reducing the amount of padding.\n",
    "  - Dynamic batching is natural to implement at the same time as bucketing, and aims to yield batches that have similar total number of elements. Batches with short utterances have larger batch size and batches with long utterances have a smaller batch size.\n",
    "  - On the fly operation is needed for streaming data loading.\n",
    "2. Don't care about exact epochs. Instead measure the number of updates and set a nominal epoch length (e.g. an epoch = 2500 updates).\n",
    "3. Don't care about exact restarts: when an experiment is restarted, data loading will not continue from the examples where it left off, but instead just begin again from randomly assigned shards.\n",
