    The cosine similarity can otherwise be determined with
    :class:`torch.nn.CosineSimilarity`.

    Arguments
    ---------
    a : torch.Tensor
        Tensor of shape `[..., X, dim]` where `dim` is the dimension where the
        cosine similarity will be computed and `X` is any value `>= 0`.
    b : torch.Tensor
        Tensor of shape `[..., Y, dim]`, where other dimensions are otherwise
        identical to `a`'s and `Y` is any value `>= 0`.
    eps : float
        Epsilon value for numerical stability, in order to avoid a division by
        zero. Does not significantly affect results.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Tensor of shape `[..., X, Y]` living on the same device and dtype as the
        input tensors. e.g. ignoring first dimensions `out[3, 0]` would be the
        cosine similarity of `a[3]` and `b[0]`.
