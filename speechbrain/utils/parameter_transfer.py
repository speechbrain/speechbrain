    First optionally collects files from some source (local directory,

    Arguments
    ---------
    collect_in : str or Path, optional
        Path to directory where the files are to be collected.
        If `None`, then files will be referred to from cache or directly, if
        possible (URLs will fail). There will not be a centralized target
        directory with all the files.

    loadables : mapping
        Mapping from loadable key to object. This connects the keys to
        the actual object instances.
    paths : mapping
        Mapping from loadable key to filepath. The last part
        of the path is treated as file name, the rest of it
        is treated as a "source" which can be either a directory
        path or a magic source like Huggingface hub ID.
        e.g. sb/asr-crdnn-libri/lm.ckpt
        -> source=sb/asr-crdnn-libri, file=lm.ckpt
        Note that when collecting, you can specify a default source,
        which is used for all loadables that don't have a path specified.
    custom_hooks : mapping
        Mapping from loadable key to parameter transfer hook function. If you
        want to use a custom loading function, specify it here.

        An optional mapping from loadable keys to condition values,
