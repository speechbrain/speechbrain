    """This method computes the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues
    of complex Hermitian matrices. The method finds a solution to
    the problem AV = BVD where V are the eigenvectors and D are
    the eigenvalues.

    The eigenvectors returned by the method (vs) are stored in a tensor
    with the following format (*,C,C,2).

    The eigenvalues returned by the method (ds) are stored in a tensor
    with the following format (*,C,C,2).

    Arguments
    ---------
    a : torch.Tensor
        A first input matrix. It is equivalent to the matrix A in the
        equation in the description above. The tensor must have the
        following format: (*,2,C+P).

    b : torch.Tensor
        A second input matrix. It is equivalent tot the matrix B in the
        equation in the description above. The tensor must have the
        following format: (*,2,C+P).
        This argument is optional and its default value is None. If
