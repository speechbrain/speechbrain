# üó£Ô∏èüí¨ What SpeechBrain Offers

- SpeechBrain is an **open-source** [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) toolkit that accelerates **Conversational AI** development, i.e., the technology behind *speech assistants*, *chatbots*, and *large language models*.

- It is crafted for fast and easy creation of advanced technologies for **Speech** and **Text** Processing.


## üåê  Vision
- With the rise of [deep learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/), once-distant domains like speech processing and NLP are now very close. A well-designed neural network and large datasets are all you need.

- We think it is now time for a **holistic toolkit** that, mimicking the human brain, jointly supports diverse technologies for complex Conversational AI systems.

- This spans *speech recognition*, *speaker recognition*, *speech enhancement*, *speech separation*, *language modeling*, *dialogue*, and beyond.

- Aligned with our long-term goal of natural human-machine conversation, including for non-verbal individuals, we have recently added support for the [EEG modality](https://github.com/speechbrain/benchmarks/tree/main/benchmarks/MOABB).



## üìö Training Recipes
- We share over 200 competitive training [recipes](recipes) on more than 40 datasets supporting 20 speech and text processing tasks (see below).

- We support both training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models such as [Whisper](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large), [Wav2Vec2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/wav2vec2), [WavLM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/wavlm), [Hubert](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/hubert), [GPT2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2), [Llama2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/llama2), and beyond. The models on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) can be easily plugged in and fine-tuned.

- For any task, you train the model using these commands:
```python
python train.py hparams/train.yaml
```

- The hyperparameters are encapsulated in a YAML file, while the training process is orchestrated through a Python script.

- We maintained a consistent code structure across different tasks.

- For better replicability, training logs and checkpoints are hosted on Dropbox.

## <a href="https://huggingface.co/speechbrain" target="_blank"> <img src="https://huggingface.co/front/assets/huggingface_logo.svg" alt="drawing" width="40"/> </a> Pretrained Models and Inference

- Access over 100 pretrained models hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain).
- Each model comes with a user-friendly interface for seamless inference. For example, transcribing speech using a pretrained model requires just three lines of code:

```python
from speechbrain.inference import EncoderDecoderASR

asr_model = EncoderDecoderASR.from_hparams(source="speechbrain/asr-conformer-transformerlm-librispeech", savedir="pretrained_models/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech")
asr_model.transcribe_file("speechbrain/asr-conformer-transformerlm-librispeech/example.wav")
```

- We are deeply dedicated to promoting inclusivity and education.
- We have authored over 30 [tutorials](https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io) that not only describe how SpeechBrain works but also help users familiarize themselves with Conversational AI.
- Every class or function has clear explanations and examples that you can run. Check out the [documentation](https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more details üìö.



## üéØ Use Cases
- üöÄ **Research Acceleration**: Speeding up academic and industrial research. You can develop and integrate new models effortlessly, comparing their performance against our baselines.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Rapid Prototyping**: Ideal for quick prototyping in time-sensitive projects.

- üéì **Educational Tool**: SpeechBrain's simplicity makes it a valuable educational resource. It is used by institutions like [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), [Avignon University](https://univ-avignon.fr/en/), and many others for student training.

## üîç Additional Features

SpeechBrain includes a range of native functionalities that enhance the development of Conversational AI technologies. Here are some examples:

- **Training Orchestration:** The `Brain` class serves as a fully customizable tool for managing training and evaluation loops over data. It simplifies training loops while providing the flexibility to override any part of the process.

- **Hyperparameter Management:** A YAML-based hyperparameter file specifies all hyperparameters, from individual numbers (e.g., learning rate) to complete objects (e.g., custom models). This elegant solution drastically simplifies the training script.

- **Dynamic Dataloader:** Enables flexible and efficient data reading.

- **GPU Training:** Supports single and multi-GPU training, including distributed training.

- **Dynamic Batching:** On-the-fly dynamic batching enhances the efficient processing of variable-length signals.

- **Mixed-Precision Training:** Accelerates training through mixed-precision techniques.

- **Efficient Data Reading:** Reads large datasets efficiently from a shared Network File System (NFS) via [WebDataset](https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset).

- **Hugging Face Integration:** Interfaces seamlessly with [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain) for popular models such as wav2vec2 and Hubert.

- **Orion Integration:** Interfaces with [Orion](https://github.com/Epistimio/orion) for hyperparameter tuning.

- **Speech Augmentation Techniques:** Includes SpecAugment, Noise, Reverberation, and more.

- **Data Preparation Scripts:** Includes scripts for preparing data for supported datasets.

SpeechBrain is rapidly evolving, with ongoing efforts to support a growing array of technologies in the future.
