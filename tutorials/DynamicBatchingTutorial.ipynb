This, combined with distributed training across multiple GPUs, enables the training of models with large parameter counts on extensive datasets in a matter of days instead of months.\n","\n","The conventional approach involves using a fixed batch size to group examples together. However, when each input has a different size, as is often the case in audio or natural language processing (NLP) applications, it necessitates padding each example in a batch to match the size of the largest one in that batch.\n","\n","While this is a common practice, it introduces a potential inefficiency when the lengths of examples exhibit significant variance. In scenarios like audio and NLP applications, a substantial portion of computation is performed on padded values, leading to computational waste. To address this issue, dynamic batching becomes essential, allowing for more efficient and resource-conscious processing of variable-length sequences in the context of diverse machine learning tasks.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tILFmgtVDaJK"},"source":["To illustrate this point, let's look, for example, at **MiniLibriSpeech** which is a subset of LibriSpeech.
