### FastSpeech2 with pre-extracted durations from a forced aligner
Training FastSpeech2 requires pre-extracted phoneme alignments (durations). The LJSpeech phoneme alignments from Montreal Forced Aligner are automatically downloaded, decompressed and stored at this location: ```/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1/TextGrid```.

To run this recipe, please first install the extra-dependencies :

```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
````

Then go into the "fastspeech2" folder and run:

```
python train.py --data_folder=/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1 hparams/train.yaml
```
Training takes about 3 minutes/epoch on 1 * V100 32G.

The training logs are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/vtgbltqdrvw9r0vs7jz67/h?rlkey=cm2mwh5rce5ad9e90qaciypox&dl=0).

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-fastspeech2-ljspeech).

### FastSpeech2 with internal alignment
This recipe allows training FastSpeech2 without forced aligner referring to [One TTS Alignment To Rule Them All](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10447.pdf). The alignment can be learnt by an internal alignment network that is added to FastSpeech2. This recipe aims to simplify training when using custom data and provide better alignments for punctuations.

To run this recipe, please first install the extra-requirements:
```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```
Then go into the "fastspeech2" folder and run:
```
python train_internal_alignment.py hparams/train_internal_alignment.yaml --data_folder=/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1
```
The data preparation includes a grapheme-to-phoneme process for the entire corpus which may take several hours. Training takes about 5 minutes/epoch on 1 * V100 32G.

The training logs are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4ctkc6jjas3uij9dzcwta/h?rlkey=i0k086d77flcsdx40du1ppm2d&dl=0).

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-fastspeech2-internal-alignment-ljspeech).

# HiFiGAN (Vocoder)
The subfolder "vocoder/hifigan/" contains the [HiFiGAN vocoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05646.pdf).
The vocoder is a neural network that converts a spectrogram into a waveform (it can be used on top of Tacotron2/FastSpeech2).

We suggest using `tensorboard_logger` by setting `use_tensorboard: True` in the yaml file, thus `Tensorboard` should be installed.

To run this recipe, go into the "vocoder/hifigan/" folder and run:

```
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder /path/to/LJspeech
```

Training takes about 10 minutes/epoch on an nvidia RTX8000.

The training logs are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m2xrdssiroipn8g/AAD-TqPYLrSg6eNxUkcImeg4a?dl=0)

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-hifigan-ljspeech).

# DiffWave (Vocoder)
The subfolder "vocoder/diffwave/" contains the [Diffwave](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09761.pdf) vocoder.

DiffWave is a versatile diffusion model for audio synthesis, which produces high-fidelity audio in different waveform generation tasks, including neural vocoding conditioned on mel spectrogram, class-conditional generation, and unconditional generation.

Here it serves as a vocoder that generates waveforms given spectrograms as conditions (it can be used on top of Tacotron2/FastSpeech2).

To run this recipe, go into the "vocoder/diffwave/" folder and run:

```
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder /path/to/LJspeech
```

The scripts will output a synthesized audio to `<output_folder>/samples` for a certain interval of training epoch.

We suggest using tensorboard_logger by setting `use_tensorboard: True` in the yaml file, thus torch.Tensorboard should be installed.

Training takes about 6 minutes/epoch on 1 * V100 32G.

The training logs are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tbhpn1xirtaix68/AACvYaVDiUGAKURf2o-fvgMoa?dl=0)

For inference, by setting `fast_sampling: True` , a fast sampling can be realized by passing user-defined variance schedules. According to the paper, high-quality audios can be generated with only 6 steps. This is highly recommended.

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-diffwave-ljspeech).


# HiFiGAN Unit Vocoder
The subfolder "vocoder/hifigan_discrete/" contains the [HiFiGAN Unit vocoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10735). This vocoder is a neural network designed to transform discrete self-supervised representations into waveform data.
This is suitable for a wide range of generative tasks such as speech enhancement, separation, text-to-speech, voice cloning, etc. Please read [DASB - Discrete Audio and Speech Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14294) for more information.

To run this recipe successfully, start by installing the necessary extra dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```

Before training the vocoder, you need to choose a speech encoder to extract representations that will be used as discrete audio input. We support k-means models using features from HuBERT, WavLM, or Wav2Vec2. Below are the available self-supervised speech encoders for which we provide pre-trained k-means checkpoints:

| Encoder  | HF model                                |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| HuBERT   | facebook/hubert-large-ll60k             |
| Wav2Vec2 | facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self  |
| WavLM    | microsoft/wavlm-large                   |

Checkpoints are available in the HF [SSL_Quantization](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/SSL_Quantization) repository. Alternatively, you can train your own k-means model by following instructions in the "LJSpeech/quantization" README.

Next, configure the SSL model type, k-means model, and corresponding hub in your YAML configuration file. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "vocoder/hifigan_discrete/hparams" folder and open "train.yaml" file.
2. Modify the `encoder_type` field to specify one of the SSL models: "HuBERT", "WavLM", or "Wav2Vec2".
3. Update the `encoder_hub` field with the specific name of the SSL Hub associated with your chosen model type.

If you have trained your own k-means model, follow these additional steps:

4. Update the `kmeans_folder` field with the specific name of the SSL Hub containing your trained k-means model. Please follow the same file structure as the official one in [SSL_Quantization](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/SSL_Quantization).
5. Update the `kmeans_dataset` field with the specific name of the dataset on which the k-means model was trained.
6. Update the `num_clusters` field according to the number of clusters of your k-means model.

Finally, navigate back to the "vocoder/hifigan_discrete/" folder and run the following command:

```bash
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder=/path/to/LJspeech
```

Training typically takes around 4 minutes per epoch when using an NVIDIA A100 40G.
