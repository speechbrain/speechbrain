"""Recipe for training a BPE tokenizer with librispeech.
The tokenizer converts words into sub-word units that can
be used to train a language (LM) or an acoustic model (AM).
When doing a speech recognition experiment you have to make
sure that the acoustic and language models are trained with
the same tokenizer. Otherwise, a token mismatch is introduced
and beamsearch will produce bas results when combining AM and LM.

To run this recipe, do the following:
> python train.py hparams/train_bpe_1k.yaml
