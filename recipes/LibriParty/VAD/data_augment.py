    Arguments
    ---------

        The waveform to append.

        The existing waveform where to append the new source.

    max_len: float

        silence samples.

        The new waveform is appended with a random amplitude sampled in the
        range min_amp-max_amp.
    max_amp: float

    chunk_shift: int
        This parameter controls where to append the new source within the
        existing one.
    speech: bool
