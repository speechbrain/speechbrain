"""
This is a preparation script for the People Speech dataset.

Data preparation for people speech is slightly different than usual for
SpeechBrain as it relies exclusively on HuggingFace Datasets. This means that
audio files will NOT be extracted but instead read from shard directly. Instead
we propose to still generate .csv files to have transcriptions and durations
readable to the user. This means that the csv file generation part can totally
be skipped and the training recipe would still work.

TL;DR: .csv files are only generated for debugging/monitoring purpose and are
not necessary to start the recipe.

    The `train.csv` file is created by combining the sets given in the `subsets`

    The `dev.csv` and `test.csv` files are created based on the `DEV` and `TEST` splits
    specified in the `splits` list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hf_download_folder : str
        The path where HF stored the dataset. Important, you must set the global
        env variable HF_HUB_CACHE to the same path as HuggingFace is primilarily

    save_folder : str

    subsets : list
