# KsponSpeech ASR with Transducers

This folder contains the scripts to train a Transducer-based speech recognizer using KsponSpeech.

You can download KsponSpeech at [Link](https://aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?currMenu=115&topMenu=100&aihubDataSe=realm&dataSetSn=123)

# How to run
Before start training, set pretrained lm and tokenizer path in the YAML file to the proper path (i.e. the directory where trained tokenizer and language model exist)

This is set to huggingface repository as a default. Pretrained models will be downloaded from the repository.

```YAML
pretrained_lm_tokenizer_path: /path/to/pretrained/models
```

Also, data_folder in the YAML file should point to the results of ksponspeech_prepare.py
```YAML
data_folder: /path/to/data/prep/results
```
Run the following to start training
```bash
python train.py hparams/conformer_transducer.yaml
```
