# Libriheavy Dataset
This folder contains the scripts to train a Transformer-based speech recognizer.

1. Please download Libri-Light at https://github.com/facebookresearch/libri-light/tree/main/data_preparation
After this step, please make sure you have all the splits (small, medium, and large) in one folder.
Please note if you want to use the large split, the large.tar file is 3.05TB. Also, the download can take quite a while.

2. Please git clone the repo https://github.com/k2-fsa/libriheavy, and follow the repo's instruction to prepare Libriheavy manifests.
After this step, please make sure you have all the "jsonl.gz" Libriheavy manifest files in one folder.

**Note 1:** This recipe relies on the `soundfile` backend for fast audio processing. Libriheavy comes with long audio files, and we need to read them in chunks. In our experiments, we found that `soundfile` was the only audio backend fast enough to read these long audio files. You can dynamically change the backend through the `--audio_backend` parameter in the YAML file.

**Note 2:** If you don't have the `large` folder but want to run this recipe with the `small` and/or `medium` splits, you need to download the official `dev` and `test` splits from the LibriSpeech dataset. This is necessary because the `dev` and `test` splits for Libriheavy are located in the `large` folder. You can download LibriSpeech at http://www.openslr.org/12 and run the `librispeech_prepare.py` script from the `recipes/LibriSpeech/` folder. Then, specify the `dev_splits` and `test_splits` parameters in the YAML file.

# How to run
```shell
python train.py hparams/transformer.yaml --data_folder=/path/to/Libri-Light --manifest_folder=/path/to/Libriheavy
```
