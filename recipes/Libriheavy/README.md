# Libriheavy

This folder contains the scripts to train an ASR system with Libriheavy.

1. Please download Libri-Light at https://github.com/facebookresearch/libri-light/tree/main/data_preparation

After this step, please make sure you have all the splits (small, medium, and large) in one folder.

Please note if you want to use the large split, the large.tar file is 3.05TB. Also, the download can take quite a while.

2. Please git clone the repo https://github.com/k2-fsa/libriheavy, and follow the repo's instruction to prepare Libriheavy manifests.

After this step, please make sure you have all the "jsonl.gz" Libriheavy manifest files in one folder.
