# Stuttering Event Detection experiments with SEP-28k (speech only)
This folder contains scripts for running stuttering event detection experiments with the SEP-28k dataset (https://github.com/apple/ml-stuttering-events-dataset). The partitioning follows the suggestion of SEP-28k-E (https://github.com/th-nuernberg/ml-stuttering-events-dataset-extended).

# Training
Run the following command to train the model:
`python train.py hparams/train.yaml`

Note that this is a minimal working example. The model and training parameters should be modified accordingly.

# Note on Data Preparation

Our `sep28k_prepare.py` will:
1. Download the dataset (including deleted podcasts impossible to download from the original script).
2. Prepare train/valid/test with partitioning suggested by https://github.com/th-nuernberg/ml-stuttering-events-dataset-extended. By default, it follows the "SEP-28k-E" partitioning.
