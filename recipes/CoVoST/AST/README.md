# CoVoST speech to text translation

This folder contains script necessary to run automatic speech translation with the [CoVoST dataset](https://github.com/facebookresearch/covost) based on [CommonVoice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets).

Two heuristics are available:
1. Training from scratch with a conformer encoder-decoder model and multitask speech recognition plus speech translation training.
2. SpeechLLM fine-tuning based on SSL speech encoders and LLaMA large language models (with and without adapters).

# How to run
```shell
python train{_xlsr_llama}.py hparams/{hparam_file}.py
```

# Data preparation
It is important to note that CommonVoice initially offers mp3 audio files. It is feasible to convert these files to .wav during data preparation, this will speed up training but also make the first data preparation to be pretty slow. Audio files are downsampled on the fly within the dataio function of the training script.

# Languages
While CoVoST offers multiple languages, this recipe only was tested on English to German translation. However, there is nothing special to do to select another language pair aside from adding a proper text normalisation on the covost_prepary.py file.
